In JavaScript, a **Promise** is an object that represents the eventual **completion (or failure)** of an **asynchronous operation** and its resulting **value**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Why Use Promises?

Traditionally, asynchronous code was handled using **callbacks**, which often led to "callback hell" â€“ nested and hard-to-read code. Promises solve this by providing a cleaner and more manageable way to handle asynchronous tasks.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Promise Syntax

```javascript
let promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  // Asynchronous task
});
```

* `resolve(value)` â€“ called when the task is successful
* `reject(error)` â€“ called when the task fails

---

### ðŸ”¹ States of a Promise

1. **Pending** â€“ Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
2. **Fulfilled** â€“ Operation completed successfully.
3. **Rejected** â€“ Operation failed.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example: Basic Promise

```javascript
let myPromise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  let success = true;

  if (success) {
    resolve("Promise fulfilled!");
  } else {
    reject("Promise rejected!");
  }
});

myPromise
  .then(function (result) {
    console.log(result); // if resolved
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error); // if rejected
  });
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Chaining Promises

```javascript
myPromise
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result);
    return "Next Step";
  })
  .then(next => {
    console.log(next);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Real-world Example (with `setTimeout`)

```javascript
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      let data = "User data";
      resolve(data);
    }, 2000);
  });
}

fetchData()
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result); // Output after 2 seconds: User data
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

### ðŸ”¹ Promise Methods

| Method           | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `.then()`        | Runs on success (`resolve`)                        |
| `.catch()`       | Runs on failure (`reject`)                         |
| `.finally()`     | Runs regardless of outcome                         |
| `Promise.all()`  | Waits for all promises to resolve or any to reject |
| `Promise.race()` | Resolves/rejects as soon as one promise settles    |

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example: `Promise.all`

```javascript
Promise.all([
  Promise.resolve(1),
  Promise.resolve(2),
  Promise.resolve(3),
]).then(values => {
  console.log(values); // [1, 2, 3]
});
```

---

### âœ… Summary

* Promises make async JavaScript easier to write and read.
* They are **objects** that hold the **future value** of an async operation.
* Use `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` to handle the result.

Would you like me to explain `async/await`, which is a more modern way to use promises?
